    The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed 
    to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976. 
    They also introduced digital signatures and attempted to apply number theory. 
    Their formulation used a shared-secret-key created from exponentiation of 
    some number, modulo a prime number. However, they left open the problem 
    of realizing a one-way function, possibly because the difficulty of factoring 
    was not well-studied at the time.

    Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of 
    Technology, made several attempts over the course of a year to create a one-way 
    function that was hard to invert. Rivest and Shamir, as computer scientists, 
    proposed many potential functions, while Adleman, as a mathematician, was responsible 
    for finding their weaknesses. They tried many approaches including "knapsack-based" 
    and "permutation polynomials". For a time, they thought what they wanted to achieve 
    was impossible due to contradictory requirements. In April 1977, they spent 
    Passover at the house of a student and drank a good deal of Manischewitz wine
    before returning to their homes at around midnight. Rivest, unable to sleep,
    lay on the couch with a math textbook and started thinking about their one-way
    function. He spent the rest of the night formalizing his idea, and he had much
    of the paper ready by daybreak. The algorithm is now known as RSA â€“ the 
    initials of their surnames in same order as their paper.

    Clifford Cocks, an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency
    Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), described an equivalent system in 
    an internal document in 1973. However, given the relatively expensive computers 
    needed to implement it at the time, it was considered to be mostly a curiosity and, 
    as far as is publicly known, was never deployed. His discovery, however, was 
    not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.

    Kid-RSA (KRSA) is a simplified public-key cipher published in 1997, designed 
    for educational purposes. Some people feel that learning Kid-RSA gives insight 
    into RSA and other public-key ciphers, analogous to simplified DES.
