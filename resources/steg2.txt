	The first description of the use of steganography dates back to the Greeks. 
	Herodotus tells how a message was passed to the Greeks about Xerses' hostile 
	intentions underneath the wax of a writing tablet, and describes a technique 
	of dotting successive letters in a cover text with a secret ink, due to 
	Aeneas the Tactician.

	Pirate legends tell of the practice of tattooing a secret information, 
	such as a map, on the head of someone, so that the hair would conceal it.

	During WWII the grille method or some variants were used by spies. In the same period, 
	the Germans developed microdot technology, which prints a clear, good quality 
	photograph shrinking it to the size of a dot.

	There are rumors that during the 1980's Margareth Thatcher, then Prime Minister in UK, 
	became so irritated about press leaks of cabinet documents, that she had the word processors 
	programmed to encode the identity of the writer in the word spacing, thus being able 
	to trace the disloyal ministers.

	During the "Cold War" period, US and USSR wanted to hide their sensors in the enemy's 
	facilities. These devices had to send data to their nations, without being spotted.

	Today, steganography is researched both for legal and illegal reasons.

	Among the first ones there is war telecommunications, which use spread spectrum or 
	meteor scatter radio in order to conceal both the message and its source.

	In the industry market, with the advent of digital communications and storage, one of the 
	most important issues is copyright enforcement, so digital watermarking techniques are 
	being developed to restrict the use of copyrighted data.

	Another important use is to embed data about medical images, so that there are no problems 
	with matching patient's records and images.

	Among illegal ones is the practice of hiding strongly-encrypted data to avoid controls by 
	cryptography export laws.
