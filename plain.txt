He [Sarek] was    delighted to discover   how very much like
him they    [computer people] were   ...  All they
cared about was the art of their
work, and doing            it right.  It was hard not
to admire such dedication and love of
computing for      its own   sake.
The programmers were the   first
Earth    people  he came   to   understand as being
really human.
