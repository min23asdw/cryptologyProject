	Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message inside of (or even on top of) something 
	that is not secret. That something can be just about anything you want. These days, many examples 
	of steganography involve embedding a secret piece of text inside of a picture. Or hiding a secret 
	message or script inside of a Word or Excel document.

	The purpose of steganography is to conceal and deceive. It is a form of covert communication 
	and can involve the use of any medium to hide messages. It’s not a form of cryptography, because it 
	doesn’t involve scrambling data or using a key. Instead, it is a form of data hiding and can be 
	executed in clever ways. Where cryptography is a science that largely enables privacy, steganography 
	is a practice that enables secrecy – and deceit.
