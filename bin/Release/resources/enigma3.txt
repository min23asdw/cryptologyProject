	Every letter printed, the information is passed to the rotor, then
 	  the 3 rotors, each rotated according to the preset pattern, 
	.	     
	this setting can be regarded as the [Enigma encryption key].
	.	
	An electrical pathway is a route for current to travel. 
	By manipulating this phenomenon the Enigma machine was able to scramble messages.[
	 The mechanical parts act by forming a varying electrical circuit. When a key is pressed, 
	one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of 
	electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or
	 fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key 
	on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. 
	Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of 
	circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display lamp, which shows the output letter. 
	.
	For example, when encrypting a message starting ANX..., the operator would first press the A key, 
	and the Z lamp might light, so Z would be the first letter of the ciphertext. The operator would next press N, 
	and then X in the same fashion, and so on.
