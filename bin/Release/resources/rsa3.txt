    RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known 
    by everyone, and it is used for encrypting messages. The intention is 
    that messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a 
    reasonable amount of time by using the private key. The public key 
    is represented by the integers n and e; and, the private key, by the integer d 
    (although n is also used during the decryption process, so it might be considered 
    to be a part of the private key, too). m represents the message 
    (previously prepared with a certain technique explained below).

    p,q is two distinct prime numbers

    n equal to p*q

    phi(φ) equal to (p-1)*(q-1)

    e is public key where 1<e<φ and greatest common divisor of e and φ equal to 1 or relatively prime

    d is private key where d times e then divided by φ and remainder is 1

    encrypt function is c = (m^e)%n 

    decrypt function is m = (c^d)%n
